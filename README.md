# -Heart-Attack-Predictor-MLP-Keras
This project implements a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) using Keras and TensorFlow to predict heart attacks. It demonstrates a complete pipeline for a binary classification problem, including data preprocessing (handling missing values and encoding), and defining a neural network to achieve high accuracy on a real-world medical dataset.
